        Parameters
        ----------
        beta : scalar
               Inverse temperature.
        gf_struct : list of pairs [ [str,[int,...]], ...]
                    Structure of the Green's functions. It must be a

                    For example: ``[ ['up', [0, 1, 2]], ['down', [0, 1, 2]] ]``.
        n_iw : integer [default=500]
               Number of Matsubara frequencies used for the Green's functions.
        n_tau : integer [default=5001]
               Number of imaginary time points used for the Green's functions.

        ----------

                        * `n_cycles`: The number of Monte-Carlo cycles

                     If not given, it will be constructed from the density matrix of
